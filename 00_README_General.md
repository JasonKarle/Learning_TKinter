# Learning_TKinter
A repository for my programs I make from various online tutorials. 

Programs will only be hosted on the repository if they are modified from the course material.

All programs from this course will be placed in this single repository, which I believe is
incorrect practice, but is done so as these are learning programs and not 100% original.

Please feel free to provide constructive criticism, especially regarding Python and Tkinter
conventions (PEP8, etc) and economies in programming.
